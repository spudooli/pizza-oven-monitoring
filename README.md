A Raspberry Pi Pizza Oven Temperature Monitoring System

http://www.spudooli.com/pizza_oven_temperature.php

To give us a better understanding of how fast or slow our wood fired pizza oven cools down, we built a Raspberry Pi Pizza Oven Monitoring System

It's a K Type thermocouple connected to a MAX31850K soldered to an Adafruit perma-prototype hat hanging off a Raspberry Pi 3. There's a python script monitoring the temperature sending the data back to the server every minute.
